Popular host Steve Harvey Hundreds game (Python based)

This is a Python based popular game known as Steve Harvey 100's. 

The game is very simple and fun. A user is allowed to select two numbers ranging from 1-20. Each number has a hidden value and a board has 10 of such hidden values with each value repeated 2 times at max. Whenever a user select two numbers the hidden values of those numbers are revealed. If both of these values matches user will get 100 bucks. If these two hidden values donot match then they are again hidden. As user selections increase he will have more possibilities of knowing the hidden value of each number. User will have 1 minute to finish the board, i.e., to get 10 correct matching pairs. The more number of correct pairs the more money.
